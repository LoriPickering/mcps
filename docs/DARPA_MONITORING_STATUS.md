# DARPA-Style Frontier Tech Monitoring System

## âœ… FULLY OPERATIONAL

All DARPA monitoring features have been successfully integrated into the MCP server.

## Available MCP Tools

### 1. `get_darpa_events`
Fetches DARPA-style frontier tech events and signals.

**Parameters:**
- `hours_back` (int, default: 24): Hours to look back for recent events
- `source` (string, default: "all"): Event source filter
  - "all" - All sources
  - "darpa" - DARPA RSS feed
  - "dod_contracts" - DoD contract awards
  - "arxiv" - Research publications

**Returns:**
- Signal events with importance ratings
- Company/ticker associations
- Technology domain classifications
- Contract values and metadata

### 2. `check_ticker_availability`
Verifies Alpaca data availability for specified tickers.

**Parameters:**
- `symbols` (array): List of ticker symbols to check

**Returns:**
- Real-time price data availability
- Last trade prices and timestamps
- Bid/ask spreads where available

- OTA agreements

### 2. Research Publications
- arXiv papers (quantum, CS/AI)
- Nature/Science breakthroughs
- Conference proceedings

### 3. Corporate Events
- Partnership announcements
- M&A activity
- Funding rounds
- Field test results

### 4. Regulatory Milestones

- FAA certifications (drones)
- DoD certifications
- Patent filings

## Event Sources

### Active Sources
- **DARPA RSS Feed**: Official announcements and news
- **DoD Contracts**: defense.gov contract awards
- **arXiv API**: Research papers in quantum and AI

### Planned Sources (Future)
- USPTO Patent API
- SEC EDGAR filings
- ClinicalTrials.gov (biotech)
- GitHub releases (open source projects)

## Integration Status

### âœ… Completed
1. DARPA events monitor module created
2. MCP server integration complete
3. All tickers verified on Alpaca free tier
4. Real-time snapshot API working
5. Event filtering and importance scoring
6. Multi-source event aggregation

### ðŸ”„ In Progress
- Historical event caching
- Event correlation with price movements
- Alert system for high-importance events

### ðŸ“‹ Planned
- Patent filing tracking
- SEC filing integration
- Clinical trial monitoring
- GitHub activity tracking

## Usage Examples

### Get DARPA Events
```python
server = MCPServer()
events = server.get_darpa_events(hours_back=48, source="all")

# Returns recent DARPA-related events with:
# - Contract awards
# - Research publications
# - Company mentions
# - Importance ratings
```

### Check Ticker Availability
```python
darpa_tickers = ["DNA", "KTOS", "IONQ", "BBAI"]
availability = server.check_ticker_availability(darpa_tickers)

# Returns real-time price data for each ticker
```

## Testing

Run the comprehensive test:
```bash
python test_darpa_availability.py
```

This tests:
- All DARPA defense stocks
- Quantum computing companies
- AI/robotics firms
- Nuclear/energy stocks
- Event fetching from all sources

## Key Insights

1. **All DARPA-related tickers are available** on Alpaca's free tier
2. **Real-time quotes** work via the snapshot API
3. **Event monitoring** successfully fetches from multiple sources
4. **Integration complete** with MCP server tools

## Next Steps

1. Monitor event correlations with price movements
2. Set up automated alerts for high-importance events
3. Add patent and SEC filing sources
4. Create event-driven trading signals
