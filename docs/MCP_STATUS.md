## How to Use:
Claude Desktop will automatically start the MCP server when needed. The configuration is already set up in:
`~/Library/Application Support/Claude/claude_desktop_config.json`

## Data Collection:
The data collector (`ta_server_full.py`) should be running continuously:
```bash
make run
```

## Monitoring:
Check system status anytime:
```bash
python check_status.py
```
