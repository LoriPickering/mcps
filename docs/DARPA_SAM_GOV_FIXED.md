# ‚úÖ SAM.gov Integration FIXED and VERIFIED

## Issue Resolved

The SAM.gov DARPA feed is now **fully operational** and showing real DARPA opportunities!

### What Was Wrong:
1. SAM.gov uses `descriptions` (array) not `description` (string)
2. The conditional filter was looking for "darpa" in content, but titles don't always contain "DARPA"
3. Since we're already searching for "DARPA" via API, all results are relevant

### What's Now Working:

#### üìä Current Results:
- **2 events** in last 24 hours (Energy Harvesting, ML2P)
- **9 events** in last 7 days
- **20 total** DARPA opportunities available

#### üéØ Active DARPA Programs Found:
1. **Energy harvesting implantable health monitoring** (Sept 24)
2. **Mapping Machine Learning to Physics (ML2P)** (Sept 23)
3. **Medics Autonomously Stopping Hemorrhage (MASH)** (Sept 20)
4. **Rads to Watts Program** (Sept 20)
5. **Manufacturing Workforce RFI** (Sept 19)
6. **High Mach Gas Turbine (HMGT)** (Sept 19)
7. **Heterogeneous Architectures for Quantum** (Sept 18)
8. **Resilient Software Systems (RSS) Accelerator** (Sept 17)

## Testing Confirmation

```bash
# Direct test shows:
‚úÖ Fetched 20 events from SAM.gov

# MCP integration shows:
üìÖ Looking back 168 hours (7 days):
‚úÖ Total events: 12
   By source:
     ‚Ä¢ arxiv: 3
     ‚Ä¢ darpa_news: 9  ‚Üê SAM.gov events now showing!
```

## Key DARPA Programs to Watch

Based on the live feed, here are frontier tech programs that could impact your DARPA portfolio:

1. **ML2P (Machine Learning to Physics)**
   - Potential Impact: AI/Quantum convergence stocks (IONQ, BBAI)
   - Bridging AI and physics simulations

2. **MASH (Autonomous Medical)**
   - Potential Impact: Biotech/Robotics (DNA, AVAV)
   - Autonomous hemorrhage control systems

3. **Quantum Architecture Program**
   - Direct Impact: IONQ, QBTS, RGTI, QUBT
   - Next-gen quantum computing infrastructure

4. **High Mach Gas Turbine**
   - Potential Impact: Defense contractors (KTOS, AVAV)
   - Hypersonic propulsion technology

## Recommended Settings

For optimal coverage of DARPA opportunities:

```python
# Use 7-day lookback to capture all weekly updates
events = server.get_darpa_events(hours_back=168, source="all")
```

## System Status

‚úÖ **SAM.gov**: 20 DARPA opportunities loading
‚úÖ **arXiv**: Quantum papers tracked and mapped to tickers
‚úÖ **Ticker Mapping**: Connecting research to stocks
‚úÖ **Real-time Quotes**: All DARPA tickers available

The DARPA frontier tech monitoring is now **fully operational** with government contract tracking!
